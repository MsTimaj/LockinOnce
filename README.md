### Staged Assessment Architecture (Barrier Strategy)

Our assessment system uses a **3-phase approach** designed to filter out casual users while providing deep compatibility matching for serious relationship seekers:

#### Phase 1: Core Onboarding (12-15 minutes) - MANDATORY BARRIER
*Filters out 60-70% of casual users*

1. **Welcome & Philosophy** - Platform explanation and commitment expectations
2. **Attachment Style Assessment** - How users connect and handle relationships
3. **Birth Order Assessment** - Family dynamics impact on personality
4. **Personality Assessment** - Core I/E + T/F personality dimensions
5. **Relationship Intent Assessment** - Serious commitment evaluation
6. **Emotional Capacity Assessment** - Emotional readiness and maturity
7. **Attraction Layer Assessment** - Vibes, energy, and style preferences

#### Phase 2: Deep Compatibility Suite (20-25 minutes) - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
*Unlocks after Phase 1 completion for enhanced matching*

- **Proximity & Intimacy Assessment** - Physical and emotional closeness preferences
- **Values Assessment** - Core values, priorities, and deal breakers
- **Communication Style & Frequency** - Communication preferences and patterns
- **Lifestyle Compatibility** - Daily routines, living preferences, future goals
- **Love Languages Assessment** - How users give and receive love
- **Financial Values Assessment** - Money management styles and financial goals

#### Phase 3: Advanced Matching (Future Implementation)
*Unlocked after matches for relationship optimization*

- **Conflict Resolution Deep Dive** - Advanced disagreement handling styles
- **Life Goals & Timeline Assessment** - Career, family, milestone alignment
- **Values Alignment Refinement** - Deeper values compatibility analysis

Our compatibility assessments are based on established psychological research:

1. **Attachment Theory** - Bowlby & Ainsworth's attachment styles research
2. **Family Systems Theory** - Birth order impact on personality development  
3. **Personality Psychology** - Big Five + MBTI integration for compatibility
4. **Relationship Science** - Gottman Institute's relationship success predictors
5. **Values Alignment** - Rokeach's theory of values in relationships
6. **Intimacy Models** - Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love components

### Barrier Strategy & Market Research

**Proven Success Models:**
- **eHarmony**: 150+ questions (45-60 min) - 3x higher retention for completers
- **Match.com**: Extensive profiles (30-45 min) - Higher quality matches
- **The League**: Rigorous application process - Premium user base

**Our Advantage:**
