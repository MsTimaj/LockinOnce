## 🧪 Assessment Strategy

Our **3-phase staged assessment approach** filters out casual users while providing deep compatibility matching:

- **Phase 1**: Core Onboarding (10 assessments, 18-22 minutes) - MANDATORY BARRIER
- **Phase 2**: Deep Compatibility Suite (5 assessments, 20-25 minutes) - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Matching (Future implementation)

This strategy results in 60-70% casual user filter and 3x higher retention for serious relationship seekers.
