## Research-Based Assessment Matching System

Love-vee uses a scientifically-grounded compatibility scoring system based on established psychological research in attachment theory, personality psychology, birth order dynamics, and relationship science.

## Core Assessment Components & Weighting

### 1. Attachment Style Compatibility (40% of overall score)
**Research Foundation**: Adult Attachment Theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth, Hazan & Shaver)

#### Secure Attachment (60-70% of population)
**Optimal Matches**: 
- Other Secure (95% compatibility) - Gold standard relationship dynamic
- Any insecure style (75-85%) - Provides healing, stabilizing influence

**What Secure Partners Bring**: Natural emotional regulation, effective communication, ability to provide safety for insecure partners, balanced intimacy and independence.

**Growth Areas Even for Secure**: 
- Patience with partners' attachment triggers
- Understanding that healing insecure attachment takes time
- Maintaining boundaries while being supportive
- Recognizing when professional help is needed for partners

#### Anxious Attachment (15-20% of population)
**Optimal Matches**:
- Secure partners (85% compatibility) - Provides stability and consistent reassurance

**Challenging Matches**:
- Other Anxious (45%) - Can amplify each other's fears and insecurities
- Avoidant (35%) - Creates destructive pursue-distance cycle
- Disorganized (40%) - Both partners' triggers can escalate chaos

**Critical Growth Areas for Anxious**:
- **Self-Soothing Skills**: Learn to calm anxiety without partner's constant reassurance
- **Internal Security Building**: Develop self-worth independent of relationship status
- **Communication Clarity**: Express needs directly rather than through emotional escalation
- **Recognizing Protest Behaviors**: Identify pursuing, demanding, or testing behaviors
- **Building Independence**: Maintain individual identity and interests within relationships
- **Anxiety vs. Intuition**: Learn to distinguish between relationship anxiety and genuine concerns

**Why Growth Matters**: Without these skills, anxious partners often push away the very connection they crave through overwhelming behaviors.

#### Avoidant Attachment (20-25% of population)
**Optimal Matches**:
- Secure partners (80% compatibility) - Respects independence while encouraging gradual intimacy

**Moderate Matches**:
- Other Avoidant (60%) - Mutual understanding but risk of emotional stagnation

**Challenging Matches**:
- Anxious (35%) - Avoidant withdrawal triggers anxious partner's abandonment fears
- Disorganized (45%) - Emotional intensity causes further withdrawal

**Critical Growth Areas for Avoidant**:
- **Emotional Awareness**: Learn to identify and name emotions rather than intellectualizing
- **Vulnerability Practice**: Start with small acts of emotional sharing and openness
- **Interdependence Understanding**: Recognize that healthy relationships enhance rather than threaten autonomy
- **Partner Attunement**: Develop ability to recognize and respond to partner's emotional needs
- **Intimacy Tolerance**: Build capacity for emotional and physical closeness without feeling overwhelmed
- **Communication of Needs**: Express relationship needs instead of withdrawing when uncomfortable

**Why Growth Matters**: Without emotional development, avoidant partners often end up isolated or in superficial relationships that lack meaningful connection.

#### Disorganized Attachment (5-10% of population)
**Optimal Matches**:
- Secure partners (75% compatibility) - Provides consistent, regulated emotional environment for healing

**Challenging Matches**:
- Any insecure style (35-45%) - Mutual triggers can create chaotic relationship dynamics

**Critical Growth Areas for Disorganized**:
- **Emotional Regulation**: Develop skills to manage intense, conflicting emotions
- **Trauma Processing**: Work with professionals to address underlying attachment trauma
- **Internal Conflict Resolution**: Learn to navigate conflicting needs for closeness and distance
- **Self-Compassion**: Develop kindness toward self during emotional struggles
- **Professional Support**: Engage in therapy specifically designed for attachment healing
- **Relationship Readiness**: Build foundational emotional stability before serious dating

**Why Growth Matters**: Disorganized attachment often stems from trauma and requires professional support for healing. Dating without this foundation can re-traumatize both partners.

### 2. Personality Compatibility (20% of overall score)
**Research Foundation**: Big Five Personality Model, Myers-Briggs research on relationship compatibility

#### Optimal Personality Pairings:
- **Introversion/Extroversion**: Complementary (60-40 split) creates balance
- **Thinking/Feeling**: Similar styles (both logical or both emotional) reduce conflict
- **Judging/Perceiving**: Slight differences create growth without major friction

#### Personality Growth Areas (All Types):
- **Self-Awareness**: Understanding your natural tendencies and triggers
- **Flexibility**: Adapting communication style to partner's needs
- **Appreciation**: Valuing partner's different strengths rather than seeing them as flaws
- **Growth Mindset**: Using personality differences as opportunities for personal development

### 3. Values Alignment (25% of overall score)
**Research Foundation**: Relationship satisfaction studies show values alignment predicts long-term success

#### Critical Values Areas:
- **Life Goals**: Career ambition, lifestyle preferences, geographic flexibility
- **Family Planning**: Children desires, parenting philosophies, family involvement
- **Financial Philosophy**: Spending, saving, financial priorities and responsibilities
- **Lifestyle Choices**: Health, social life, personal growth priorities

#### Values Growth Areas (All Users):
- **Clarity**: Knowing your own values deeply, not just surface preferences
- **Communication**: Articulating values clearly to potential partners
- **Flexibility**: Understanding which values are negotiable vs. non-negotiable
- **Respect**: Honoring partner's different values even when you don't share them

### 4. Birth Order Dynamics (10% of overall score)
**Research Foundation**: Adlerian psychology, birth order relationship research

#### Optimal Birth Order Pairings:
- **Opposites Attract**: Oldest with youngest, middle with only child
- **Complementary Roles**: Different family positions create natural balance

#### Birth Order Growth Areas:
- **Role Awareness**: Understanding how family position shaped your relationship expectations
- **Flexibility**: Not rigidly sticking to family-of-origin roles in romantic relationships
- **Communication**: Discussing expectations around responsibility, decision-making, and caregiving

### 5. Lifestyle Compatibility (5% of overall score)
- **Activity Levels**: Exercise, outdoor activities, social preferences
- **Daily Rhythms**: Morning/evening preferences, work-life balance
- **Social Needs**: Introversion/extroversion in practice, friend group integration

## Matching Process

### Strict Preference Enforcement
ALL matches must meet user's stated preferences:
- **Gender Preference**: Absolutely non-negotiable
- **Age Range**: Exact range compliance required
- **Deal Breakers**: Never matched with deal breaker traits
- **Must Haves**: Required criteria must be met
- **Location/Distance**: Within specified geographic parameters

### Compatibility Scoring Integration
Once preference filtering is complete, remaining profiles are scored using research-based compatibility algorithms and ranked by overall compatibility percentage.

### Minimum Compatibility Threshold
Profiles below 45% overall compatibility are not shown, ensuring quality over quantity in match suggestions.

## AI Coaching Integration
