# LoveVee Matching Algorithm - Research-Based Compatibility System

## Overview
LoveVee's matching algorithm combines strict preference enforcement with scientifically-backed assessment compatibility to create optimal romantic matches. Our system is built on peer-reviewed relationship research and psychological studies.

## Preference Filtering (100% Strict Enforcement)

### Non-Negotiable Preferences
ALL matches must meet these criteria with ZERO flexibility:

1. **Gender Preference**
   - Users selecting "women" see ONLY female profiles
   - Users selecting "men" see ONLY male profiles
   - Users selecting "nonbinary" see ONLY nonbinary profiles
   - Users selecting "everyone" see all genders

2. **Age Range**
   - Profiles outside specified age range are completely excluded
   - No flexibility or "close enough" matching

3. **Deal Breakers (Absolute Exclusions)**
   - Religion: Profiles with deal-breaker religions are never shown
   - Politics: Profiles with deal-breaker political views are never shown
   - Lifestyle: Profiles with deal-breaker lifestyle choices are never shown

4. **Must-Haves (Required Attributes)**
   - Education: Only profiles meeting education requirements
   - Career Ambition: Only profiles matching ambition level preferences

5. **Children Preference**
   - Strict matching except "maybe" allows compatibility with "yes" or "no"
