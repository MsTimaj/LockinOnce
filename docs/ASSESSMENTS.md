## ðŸ”¢ Scoring & Matching Algorithm

### Compatibility Scoring Framework

Each assessment generates weighted scores that contribute to overall compatibility:

   - Secure + Any = High compatibility
   - Anxious + Avoidant = Low compatibility
   - Similar insecure styles = Moderate compatibility

2. **Complementary Personality Pairings**
   - Introvert + Extrovert = Balanced energy
   - Thinking + Feeling = Complementary decision-making
   - Similar types = Shared understanding

3. **Values Alignment Scoring**
   - Core values must align (family, career, lifestyle)
   - Different interests can complement
   - Deal breakers eliminate matches

4. **Intimacy Preference Matching**
   - Physical affection levels must be compatible
   - Emotional vulnerability comfort alignment
   - Communication frequency preferences

5. **Emotional Readiness Thresholds**
   - Minimum emotional capacity scores required
