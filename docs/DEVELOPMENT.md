### 🚨 Critical Gaps Identified

#### Communication System (MISSING)
**Status**: Not implemented
**Impact**: Core dating app functionality absent
**Needs**:
- Direct messaging between matched users
- Real-time chat interface with message history
- Connection request/acceptance flow
- Online status and typing indicators

#### AI Intelligence Enhancement (NEEDS WORK)
**Current Issues**:
- Love-vee responses are generic, not personalized
- No context awareness of user's assessment results
- Limited coaching based on compatibility insights
- Missing proactive conversation starters

**Required Improvements**:
- Context-aware responses using attachment style, personality data
- Relationship coaching specific to compatibility challenges
- Conversation prompts based on match compatibility scores
- Progress tracking and relationship milestone suggestions

#### Backend Logic & Calculations (CRITICAL)
**Current State**: All calculations run client-side with localStorage
**Critical Needs**:
- **User Authentication**: Proper auth system (currently localStorage only)
- **Data Persistence**: Multi-device sync and reliable storage
- **Real-time Features**: Live messaging and status updates
- **Learning Algorithm**: Improve matches based on user behavior
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for growing user base

#### Dashboard & Matching Flow (ENHANCEMENT NEEDED)
**Current Issues**:
- No connection management after "interested" clicks
- Missing conversation starters for new matches
- No filtering/sorting options for matches
- Limited match interaction tracking
- Passed users can reappear

**Required Features**:
- Connection status management (pending, connected, chatting)
- Match interaction history and preferences learning
- Advanced filtering (distance, age, compatibility scores)
- Mutual matching system (both users must be interested)
- Smart match pool regeneration with "second chance" logic

### MVP Success Criteria 📊 - Updated
