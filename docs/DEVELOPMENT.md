#### What's Actually Working
- Users can complete the full assessment-to-matches journey
- Assessment data drives match generation algorithms
- Results are calculated and displayed meaningfully
- Local state persistence maintains user progress
- All core navigation and routing functions properly

### Immediate MVP Priorities 🔥

#### Week 1: Core Intelligence
- **Real Compatibility Calculations** - Replace placeholder algorithms with actual compatibility scoring
- **Enhanced Match Details** - Show users WHY matches are compatible with detailed breakdowns
- **Connection System** - Simple like/pass functionality for match interactions

#### Week 2: Polish & Demo-Ready
- **Improved Love-vee Responses** - More contextual, intelligent coaching advice
- **Enhanced Match Profiles** - Diverse, realistic match data for better demos
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases and failures

#### Week 3: Final Polish
- **User Profile Insights** - Help users understand their own assessment results
- **Compatibility Education** - Explain matching science to users
- **Demo Optimization** - Final UI/UX polish for presentations

### MVP Success Criteria 📊

**Demo Must Show:**
1. Complete assessment flow (14 steps, ~20 minutes)
2. Intelligent compatibility analysis and scoring
3. Generated matches with clear compatibility explanations
4. AI coaching companion providing relationship advice
5. Professional, relationship-focused platform experience

**Technical Requirements:**
- No authentication complexity (localStorage persistence sufficient)
- Reliable state management throughout user journey
- Professional UI/UX on desktop and mobile
- Graceful error handling for common edge cases
- Fast performance and smooth interactions

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Environment Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Modern browser for testing

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
```

### MVP Development Workflow
1. Focus on user journey completion over enterprise features
2. Test full assessment-to-matches flow regularly
3. Prioritize demo-ready polish over scalability
4. Maintain TypeScript strict mode and clean code practices
5. Test thoroughly on mobile and desktop
